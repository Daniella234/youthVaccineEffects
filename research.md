- “Researchers have studied the use of mRNA in vaccines for influenza, Zika, and rabies. It’s also been studied as a treatment for cancer.”
- “Because while kids may be less likely to get very sick with COVID-19, there’s evidence that children over the age of 10 can spread the virus just as efficiently as infected adults.”

## [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/covid-19-vaccines-for-kids/art-20513332)
- “Because COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials only started in the summer of 2020, it's not yet clear if the vaccines will have long-term effects. However, vaccines rarely cause long-term effects. A portion of the children ages 12 through 15 enrolled in the ongoing Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine study were monitored for safety for at least two months after being given the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.”

- Some side effects of the vaccine for young people are pain, redness, and swelling on the arm where you got the shot. You may also feel tired, have a headache, get the chills, have a fever, feel nauseous, etc. “These side effects may affect your child’s ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.”

## [Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care](https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/vaccine/COVID-19_vaccine_information_sheet_youth.pdf)
- “Ongoing studies on the COVID-19 vaccines indicate serious side effects found to date are extremely rare. People who have received the vaccine in these studies continue to be monitored for any longer-term side effects.”
